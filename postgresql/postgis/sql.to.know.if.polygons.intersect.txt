select v.ogc_fid from datasources.r05_2013_valparaiso_4 v join datasources.test_polygon_2 t on st_intersects(v.geom, t.geom)


st_intersects it's a Boolean
st_intersection gives the polygon that intersects, but I think I won't need it,
the thing that Seba was asking was the fields from the things that intersect, so
it's just getting the ids and then getting the info
