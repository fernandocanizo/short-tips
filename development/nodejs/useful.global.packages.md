# Useful global packages

Context: last node upgrade I did:

```
nvm install v8.11.4 --reinstall-packages-from-v8.11.3; wait; nvm uninstall v8.11.3
```

Notice how I missed the equality sign (`=`) and instead used a dash (`-`),
resulting in the complete loss of my global installed packages and, of course,
I don't recall their names. I vaguely recall what I used some stuff for, but
not their names.

So I'm starting this list in order to have a permanent way to know what I use as
global installed packages.
